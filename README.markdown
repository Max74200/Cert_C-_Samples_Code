# SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard samples

This repo contains unaltered\* copies of all sample code from the _rules_ outlined in the [SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88046682). These source code files have been modify to compile. Some of them are completly or partialy commented because i don't find a way to compile them. They are meant for use in gauging the effectiveness of static analyzers (for my case it is SonarQube) against CERT's rules for the C++ programming language. 

\* A single, one-line comment has been added to the top of each code sample to help associate it with its parent rule and, if available, provide some context.

## Nomenclature

Sample source files are found within the various subdirectories of the `rules` directory:

- `nc*.cpp` are non-compliant code samples
- `c*.cpp` are compliant code samples
- `ex*.cpp` are exception code samples

Code samples follow an origin 0 numbering scheme, _e.g._, the first non-compliant sample for a given rule is named `nc0.cpp`, the second `nc1.cpp`, and so forth. Code samples are numbered in the order they appear within the body of a rule. Occasionally, a sample is multipart, in which case its parts follow the form, `nc0-a.cpp`, `nc0-b.cpp`, and so on.

## Legal statement

All of the C++ source code files in the `rules` directory have been copied directly from the SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard. Accordingly, all of these source files are _Copyright Â© Carnegie Mellon University. All Rights Reserved._
